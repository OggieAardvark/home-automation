# home-automation
# looking to link energy monitoring smappee to large smart devices such a fridges and washer/dryers. I would like to have a control system  that can monitor energy consumption, solar production, battery levels and grid input. 
# when there is excess sun i want to use that power behind the meter, maybe make the frezzer cool a little lower, or heat the house or consume energy that will be consumed that day but make it coinside with the actual production of the sun.
